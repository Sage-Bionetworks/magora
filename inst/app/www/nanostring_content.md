This explorer shows the extent to which gene expression changes in MODEL-AD mouse models mimic expression changes in humans with AD. 

In this analysis, gene expression changes in each mouse model are calculated compared to controls. The resulting fold-change for each gene is then correlated with the fold-change in human AD vs control.

The correlations between mouse and human for each gene are then mapped to consensus network modules from a harmonized co-expression analysis based on 3 human postmortem brain cohorts.

BLUE depicts a positive correlation, in which the gene expression changes in the mouse model are similar to changes in humans. RED depicts a negative correlation, in which the gene expression changes in the mouse model are in the opposite direction of humans.
