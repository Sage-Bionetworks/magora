All MODEL-AD RNAseq is carried out using standardized protocols. Note that the two centers use slightly different protocols. UCI performs RNAseq on both hippocampus and cortex, while IU/Jax/Pitt performs RNAseq on hemibrains.

Log2 fold change has been computed for each model x sex x age combination in comparison to predefined controls, as follows:

* 5xFAD vs C57BL/6J
* 3xTg-AD vs B6129
* Trem2 vs C57BL/6J
* APOE4/Trem2 vs C57BL/6J
* APOE4 vs C57BL/6J
* hABKI vs C57BL/6J
 
Both UCI and IU/Jax/Pitt centers have characterized the 5xFAD model; other mouse models were characterized by only one of the two centers.
