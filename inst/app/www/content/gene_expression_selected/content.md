This heatmap shows differential expression of genes from RNA sequencing analyses. 

Please select gene(s), model(s), sex(es), and age(s) from the dropdown lists. You can select gene(s) by entering the name(s) or selecting from the list.

Significantly upregulated genes in the model compared to control are shown in <span class = "blue">BLUE</span>, and downregulated genes are shown in <span class = "red">RED</span>. The size of the circle corresponds to the adjusted P value.
