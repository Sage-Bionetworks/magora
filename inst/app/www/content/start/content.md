### Characterization of MODEL-AD mice

New mouse models are phenotyped across multiple neuropathology, genomics, and behavioral levels. New data and analyses are regularly released and will be reflected by updates to the explorers on this site. Currently available models and data are depicted in this table.

### Additional resources and data

All MODEL-AD mouse models and data are cataloged in the AD Knowledge Portal.
