### About MODEL-AD

MODEL-AD comprises two research centers with complementary approaches to generating new mouse models that more faithfully recapitulate features of Alzheimer's disease in humans. Mouse models are phenotyped using standardized neuropathology, 'omics, and behavioral measures.

### How to use this site

The Model AD Explorer shares summaries of phenotypic data for available mouse models. Currently available data include:
  
<a id = "link_pathology" href = "#" onclick="link('Pathology')">**Pathology data**</a>: View neuron and glial cell counts, plaque density and size, and amyloid levels by sex and age.  

<a id = "link_gene_expression_volcano" href = "#" onclick="link('GeneExpressionVolcano')">**Gene expression**</a>: Explore all up- and down-regulated genes in a selected model or use the <a id = "link_gene_expression_heatmap" href = "#" onclick="link('GeneExpressionHeatmap')">"Selected Genes"</a> view to see which models show differential expression of a selected gene. 

<a id = "link_nanostring" href = "#" onclick="link('Nanostring')">**Correlation with Human Disease**</a>: Compare gene expression changes in mouse models with gene expression changes that occur in human disease. 

Visit <a id = "link_available_models" href = "#" onclick="link('AvailableModels')">**Available Models and Data**</a> to learn what data is currently available in the Explorer. New data and analyses will be incorporated as they are available.
